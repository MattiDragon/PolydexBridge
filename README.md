PolydexBridge is a fabric mod that brings over recipes from [Polydex](https://modrinth.com/mod/polydex) to [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi)
for more convenient browsing.
It must be installed both on the client and server in order to function, but it will disable itself if not present on both sides.

PolydexBridge brings over all recipes outside the vanilla categories in polydex.
It should be able to properly bring over most polydex recipes, and it provides decent support for EMI features,
like the recipe tree.

## Compatibility
This mod uses internals of both Polydex and EMI in order to implement recipe syncing.
A future update to either mod could easily break PolydexBridge. 
If that happens the issue should be reported on this mods GitHub Page.

Using different versions of PolydexBridge on the client and server is not supported,
expect to be disconnected with errors.
